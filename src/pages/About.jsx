          <p className="text-gray-500 mb-4">
            This brand was not born out of business ambitions, but out of faith,
            love, and a calling to serve. Every handcrafted piece we bring
            forth—be it a crocheted bag, a small origami, a mat, or a coaster—is
            more than an item. It is a creation infused with dignity, hope, and
            devotion. Women have always been the silent weavers of homes and
            hearts. Many of them carry untold stories—of strength, of sacrifice,
            of creativity waiting for a stage. At vaRshheal23, we believe they
            are not alone. With Shree Ji's blessings, they carry divine strength
            within them, and through their craft, they shine with a light that
            deserves to be seen by the world. This is not just a platform for
            selling handmade products. It is a sanctuary for women to stand tall
            through their art, earn with dignity, and feel celebrated for their
            talent. Each stitch, each weave, each design is a prayer—a reminder
            that creativity is sacred, and no woman's talent should remain
            hidden.
